## Database 2: MariaDB

MariaDB is an open source database accessible through this website: https://mariadb.org/. It is a relational database and its hosting models are local, cloud, and client/server. To connect it to Python, you need to connect to the MariaDB server by importing MariaDB Connector/Python. Then using SQL, you are able to retrieve, add, and catch exceptions in the data and further connect Python to MariaDB.
