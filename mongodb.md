## Database 5: MongoDB

MongoDB is an open source database accessible through this website: https://www.mongodb.com/. It is a document database and its hosting models are cloud, embedded, local, and client/server. For Python to access it, you need to install PyMongo in your environment. You then need to create the mongodb client to get the connection by adding a connection string to the database.
